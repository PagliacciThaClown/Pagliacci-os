                    <p style= "color: green">Escalating tensions between North Korea and the United States, including threats by both countries that they could use nuclear weapons against one another, prompted a heightened state of readiness in Hawaii.[2][3][4] North Korea had conducted several intercontinental ballistic missile tests over the past year, most recently in November 2017,[5] enhancing its strike capabilities.[6] It is possible that North Korea may have the capability to deliver nuclear missiles to Hawaii.[7][8] Hawaii is located roughly 4,600 miles (7,400 km) from North Korea,[3] and a missile launched from North Korea would leave perhaps 12 to 15 minutes of warning time.[9]

                        Hawaii officials had been working for some time to refresh the state's emergency plans in case of a nuclear attack from North Korea.[3][10] An October 2017 email from the University of Hawaii to students with the subject line "In the event of a nuclear attack",[11] containing instructions from the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency on how to react in case of a nuclear attack,[12] caused controversy;[11] a university spokesman ultimately apologized for "any needless concern it may have caused".[13] Testing of the civil defense warning sirens and attack drills were also conducted in the state on the first business day of the month beginning in December 2017.[4][14][15][16] On December 1, 2017, a nuclear threat siren was tested in Hawaii for the first time in more than 30 years,[3][16][17][18] the first of what state officials said would be monthly drills.[15][16][19] At 11:45 a.m. on January 2, 2018, the state conducted its monthly test of the civil defense outdoor warning siren system including the sounding of a one-minute Attention Alert Signal (Steady Tone) followed by a one-minute Attack Warning Signal (Wailing Tone).[20][21] There was no exercise or drill accompanying the test.[21] Prior to January 13, 2018, 26 drills had been conducted.[22] Vern Miyagi, the administrator of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, explained that state leaders "couldn't ignore these constant threats and missile tests from North Korea" and felt the need to prepare residents for the possibility of an attack. Officials also outlined what would happen if an emergency alert were sent: a push alert to smartphones and a message interrupting television and radio broadcasts.[17][23]
                        
                        Earlier in January 2018, U.S. Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said the commission planned to vote to overhaul the wireless emergency alert system.[24][25] The proposed reforms include providing more detailed information in alerts and confining emergency notifications to a more specific geographic area. Pai said he hoped the reforms, which would take effect in late 2019 if approved by the FCC, would lead to greater use of the alert system in local emergency situations and prompt people to take alerts they receive more seriously.[25][26]The alert was sent at 8:07 a.m. Hawaii–Aleutian Standard Time.[27] People in Hawaii reported seeing the alert on their smartphones. Many screenshots of the push alert were shared on social media platforms, such as Twitter.[28][29] The alert read, in all capital letters:[30]
        
                        BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbTWJTK2oCs&ab_channel=Jos%C3%A9AntonioNavarro">THIS IS NOT A DRILL.</a>
                        
                        Local television broadcasts, including a college basketball game between Florida and Ole Miss being shown on CBS affiliate KGMB and a Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Everton on NBC affiliate KHNL were also interrupted by a similar alert message, broadcast as a Civil Danger Warning.[31][32][33] The alert message on television broadcasts took the form of both an audio message and a scrolling banner. It stated in part:[34]
                        
                        The U.S. Pacific Command has detected a missile threat to Hawaii. A missile may impact on land or sea within minutes. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. If you are indoors, stay indoors. If you are outdoors, seek immediate shelter in a building. Remain indoors well away from windows. If you are driving, pull safely to the side of the road and seek shelter in a building or lay on the floor. We will announce when the threat has ended. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. Take immediate action measures.
                        
                        An alert message also interrupted radio broadcasts in the state.[35][36] In Lihue, a resident reported hearing a message on the radio advising of "an incoming missile warning for the islands of Kauai and Hawaii".[37]     
                        Culpability for the false alert was attributed to an employee at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, who officials said was a 10-year agency veteran[38] who had previously exhibited behavior that had troubled coworkers, according to The Washington Post.[39] Vern Miyagi, then-administrator of HI-EMA, said the alert had been inadvertently triggered by the employee as he was working at the Diamond Head Crater headquarters[40][41] during a shift change.[40] During the shift change, a supervisor ran an unscheduled drill[41] in which he contacted emergency management workers in the guise of an officer from U.S. Pacific Command, according to state officials.[42] The supervisor deviated from the script, officials said, erroneously stating at one point, "This is not a drill," although he reportedly did state before and after the message, "Exercise, exercise, exercise," agency code to indicate a test rather than an actual emergency.[42]
                        Officials said that upon hearing the supervisor's statement, the employee, who had "confused real life events and drills" at least twice before[39] believed there was an actual emergency, and he later attested to this in a written statement.[42] In an interview with NBC News, the employee shared that he was, "100 percent sure that it was the right decision and that it was real."

                            </a> The man went on to state that he is not to blame for the incident, that overall it was a system failure, and that he did exactly what he was trained to do.[43] He clicked the button to send out an actual notification on Hawaii's emergency alert interface during what was intended to be a test of the state's ballistic missile preparations computer program[44][45][a] and then clicked through a second screen, which had been intended as a safeguard, to confirm.[46][47][b] An agency spokesman told The Washington Post that the employee was prompted to choose between the options "test missile alert" and "missile alert", had selected the latter, initiating the alert sent out across the state.[50] The employee later claimed to the Associated Press that he had not heard the "exercise" part of the phone call because a co-worker had placed it on speakerphone partway into the message, and as a result, he had been "100 percent sure" the attack was real.[51] State officials said five other workers were present at the agency at the time and all of them recognized the phone call as an impromptu drill.[52] Since this incident, the employee responsible has received numerous death threats and has expressed on multiple occasions his apologies
                        At the beginning of “Joker,” Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), seated in front of a mirror, hooks a finger into each corner of his mouth, and pulls. Up, then down: a grin, a grimace. We are meant to think of the masks, comic and tragic, that were worn by the actors in ancient Greek drama. Over the next couple of hours, those two moods will be welded together, until we can’t tell the light from the dark.

                        Arthur is a clown, and a would-be comic, but he’s really not funny at all. So badly does he bomb at a comedy club that footage of his set is replayed on television. That’s the joke. He lives in Gotham City, which, as everybody knows, equals New York City minus the peace and the pastoral bliss. The year, by my reckoning, is 1981, since “Blow Out” and “Zorro: The Gay Blade” are advertised on cinema marquees. Other highlights include a garbage strike. Arthur works for a clown agency, and one of his jobs is to stand on the street in a red nose and a green wig, holding a promotional sign for a local store. When some kids grab the sign, he gives chase, his enormous shoes clomping on the sidewalk. Another clown lends him a gun, for safety’s sake, but it drops out of Arthur’s costume, clattering to the floor, while he’s entertaining children in a hospital ward and singing “If You’re Happy and You Know It.” A tough gig for Arthur, who says, “I haven’t been happy one minute of my entire fucking life.”
                        
                        And there you have it. “Joker” is a miserabilist manifesto. It’s directed by Todd Phillips, who co-wrote it with Scott Silver, and whose previous films, from “Road Trip” (2000) and “Old School” (2003) to the “Hangover” triptych, have delighted in the imperishable idiocy of the American male, and in his stubborn plans to dodge the draft of adulthood. Arthur Fleck, you might say, represents a nasty new twist on this theme. He still shares an apartment with his aging mother, Penny (Frances Conroy); their relationship is close but tense—he washes her hair while she takes a bath—and he must search for confidants elsewhere. As well as befriending, or imagining that he has befriended, a single mother (Zazie Beetz) who lives in his building, he meets with a social worker (Sharon Washington), appointed by the city, who monitors his medication. We learn from her that Arthur has been institutionalized in the past, and he carries a card that he shows to people when they flinch away from him. It reads “Forgive my laughter: I have a condition.”
                        
                        But what condition? Could it be pseudobulbar affect, which is neurological in origin and gives rise to uncontained laughing and crying? Under stress, Arthur certainly breaks into a hyena’s cackle, which stops as abruptly as it starts; he also weeps, and, in closeup, we follow the tracks of the tears on his clown’s white-painted face. (I haven’t seen such artful drips since 1971, when Dirk Bogarde’s hair dye melted, along with his soul, at the end of “Death in Venice.”) The film, however, takes no serious interest in what might be wrong with Arthur. It merely invites us to watch his wrongness grow out of control and swell into violence, and proposes a vague connection between that private swelling and a wider social malady. “Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?” he asks. Guess what: it’s both!
                        
                        “Joker” is not plotted so much as crammed with mangy incidents. Like animals, they come in two by two. By a charming coincidence, for example, two major scenes take place in public toilets. There are also two extended subway sequences: one in which Arthur uses his gun for the first time, and another in which, pursued by police, he ducks in and out of the carriages, as if in homage to “The French Connection” (1971). Most important of all, we get two father figures. One is Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the host of a TV talk show, under whose wing Arthur dreams of finding shelter and approval. The other is Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), a wealthy brute who is running for mayor of Gotham. (He has a young son named Bruce. Get it?) Thirty years ago, Penny Fleck worked for him, and Arthur hopes to exploit that distant link, though Wayne has nothing but scorn for the Flecks of this fragmented world. “Those of us who have made something of our lives will always look at those who haven’t,” he declares, “and see nothing but clowns.”
                        
                        Trailing clouds of controversy, “Joker” descends upon us.
                         The online discussion has mounted from the rampant to the manic, undeterred, or perhaps exacerbated, by the fact that nobody, apart from critics and festivalgoers, has actually seen the movie. (Emotions run high when people are low on facts.) In one corner are those who crave a masterpiece: a film that will unearth a new psychic intensity in the domain of the comic book, ideal for our distended times. In the opposite corner are those who fear that Phillips and Phoenix may give license to all the lonely people out there—in particular, to any messed-up white guys who feel wretchedly uncherished and would welcome a tutorial in the art of lashing out.</p>
