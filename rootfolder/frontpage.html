                    The article of impeachment accuses Trump of “willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States” in violation of his oath and duty. Once it passes, which we expect it will, Trump will be the first US president in history to be impeached twice.
                    
                    Floor debate began shortly after 9 a.m. ET, while a vote is expected mid-to-late afternoon, according to House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern.

                        Members will vote in staged groups on the House floor due to coronavirus, while some will vote by proxy.
                    
                    On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said that the impeachment article would be sent to the Senate quickly, which would then hold a trial – as opposed to holding onto it for up to 100 days in order to give the Biden administration time to get to work without impeachment theater upstaging their agenda.
                    
                    “The timing was thrust upon us by the actions of the president of the United States. The fact that he is leaving should not divert us from holding accountable behavior which many of us believe is treasonous behavior and criminal behavior,” Hoyer told MSNBC. Clowns have never been straightforwardly funny. Connoisseurs of pulp fiction will cite King’s Pennywise. Comics fans will think of Batman’s antagonist, the Joker. Anti-corporate activists will probably point to Ronald McDonald. But the killer-clown meme is grounded in a far more sordid reality. David Wilson, professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, was lecturing on just this subject earlier in the summer, before the current wave of clown-related incidents. “We’ve got a brand new module that I teach in the final year about serial murder,” he says. “I was showing the students some images of killer clowns. And the idea of a killer clown is all too real if you know the history of John Wayne Gacy.” An American serial killer and rapist, Gacy was convicted of the murders of 33 boys and young men in Cook Country, Illinois between 1972 and 1978. He was also well known in his community as Pogo the Clown, performing at children’s parties and fundraising events. As he was arrested, Gacy is reported to have said: “You know, clowns can get away with murder.”

             In 1955, R. Gordon Wasson set off for southern Mexico to experience a sacred Indian ceremony rumored to provide a “pathway to the divine.” Wasson later extolled the mystical effects of what he called the “magic mushroom,” the Mexican plant used in the ceremony, in a 1957 photo-essay for Life magazine.
    
                    Wasson’s article, read by millions, helped set the stage for an eventual cultural revolution that peaked with Timothy Leary, the former Harvard professor who proselytized for LSD and called on Americans to “turn on, tune in, drop out.” The seminal role Wasson’s trip played in promoting mind-bending drugs and the accompanying cultural revolution has been described before, including in Michael Pollan’s recent book, “How to Change Your Mind,” but a new biography by Stephen Kinzer, a former foreign correspondent for The New York Times, adds a key detail to this fascinating history.
                    
                    “Poisoner in Chief: Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA Search for Mind Control” describes how, unbeknown to Wasson, the spy agency was funding his travel. In fact, Wasson’s trip “would electrify mind control experimenters in Washington whose ambitions were vastly different from his own.” Kinzer’s book traces the life and career of Gottlieb, the man standing in the shadows of this trip. Gottlieb was also the brains behind the eventual C.I.A. program it helped spawn, MK-ULTRA, the notorious research endeavor that employed mind-altering drugs, including LSD.
                    
                    The broad outlines of MK-ULTRA are fairly well established even if many of the details are lost to the C.I.A.’s document destruction. Beginning in 1950, the agency, fearful of reported Communist brainwashing, began a top-secret project initially known as Bluebird, to explore ways to influence the human psyche. The program expanded dramatically with the entry of Gottlieb, a chemist with a deep-seated interest in mysticism. Kinzer describes him as “the first person the United States government ever hired to find ways to control human minds.”
                    
                    Like other troubling figures of C.I.A. history, for instance the paranoid mole hunter James Jesus Angleton, Gottlieb played a seminal role in shaping the agency in the 1950s and 1960s. He was also an outlier. Gottlieb, who grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family in the Bronx, didn’t fit into the Georgetown set that dominated the C.I.A. in those years. But he was valued and protected, particularly by Allen Dulles, the director of central intelligence, who believed deeply in mind-control experiments. Gottlieb was someone who could do the agency’s dirty work. And dirty it was. The ICP aesthetic is a below-brow mix of Tales from the Crypt comics gore and puerile shock-jockery. It's most proudly displayed during the group's live act, in which Bruce and Utsler—both of whom hail from the suburbs—disguise themselves with black and white clown makeup and throw gangsta leans while dousing their audiences with sticky geysers of Faygo, a midwestern econo-buy soda. Not surprisingly, the music industry has long treated ICP with the sort of wary contempt with which one would eye a Chinese battery landfill. Radio stations and MTV mostly refuse to play the band, while critics have declared ICP the worst act in music (Blender) and dismissed the group as a modern-day minstrel act (Spin). And though ICP has been signed to major labels several times, each deal has collapsed.

                    For years, ICP operated on the fringes of the record business, selling just enough discs to get the media's attention, however unfavorable. But by the early '00s, with Eminem and Saw-style torture-porn movies making millions, ICP's face-painted crudity no longer seemed outrè9. For a good decade or so, most of the mainstream world basically stopped paying attention to Insane Clown Posse, and the group went underground.
                    
                    That is, until last spring, when the men behind ICP did something so strange, so offensive, the rest of the world couldn't help but take notice: They got deep. Provocative conspiracy mill Alex Jones is being sued by the families of children killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre. Jones spent a lot of airtime suggesting the shooting was a hoax, convincing his followers that the families of those killed in the shooting were “actors” or government plants.

                    These most recent lawsuits were filed by Veronique De La Rosa, Neil Heslin, and Leonard Pozner, parents, respectively, of Noah Pozner and Jesse Lewis, six-year-olds who were killed at school.

 <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">
    Both Jones and InfoWars were named in the lawsuit. The individual lawsuits are asking for damages because of “mental stress and anguish” as well as “psychological pain” that came as a result of Jones’ consistent, meritless assertions these people were part of a government conspiracy or worse. Specifically, the lawsuits allege: “Defendants’ defamatory publications were designed to harm the Plaintiffs’ reputation and subject the Plaintiffs to public contempt, disgrace, ridicule, or attack… Defendants’ defamatory statements were knowingly false or made with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the statements at the time the statements were made.”
                    
                    These claims are tough to prove in court, regardless of the nature of Jones’ commentary, because he has long maintained he’s not a news provider but, instead, an entertainer. During his rants, Jones claimed, multiple times, that Sandy Hook was a “giant hoax” perpetrated by “crisis actors” working for groups that oppose the Second Amendment or factions within the government that want to take people’s guns away. One of these rants specifically included an interview with De La Rosa that Jones claimed looked to be staged with a green screen. De La Rosa calls that assertion “manifestly false” and “a sick lie” that Jones profited from. Heslin appeared on media programs to protest Jones and support his version of events, saying, among other things: “I held my son with a bullet hole through his head…” InfoWars employee Owen Shroyer made the claim this was not possible, even though reports clearly state parents were allowed to see their children on site, after the on-scene investigation was completed.
                    
                    Jones laughed off the lawsuits, saying they would be “thrown out of court because they have no merit” and judged as “frivolous.” Jones used this opportunity to, once again, go after the “corporate media,” a favorite target of his and red meat for his followers.</p>
